## SmartWait – Evidence Snippets (drop into your deck)

- Alberta wait list scale (2025)
  - “Alberta health‑care wait lists climb past half a million” — CTV News (2025).
  - Talking point: Long waits create measurable harm; some patients die while waiting for treatment.

- Specialist/surgical wait times (Canada)
  - Median total wait time from GP referral to treatment has been 25–30+ weeks in recent years (Fraser Institute annual reports; CIHI reporting varies by procedure).
  - Talking point: Alberta’s specialist access lags the clinically recommended targets in many areas.

- No‑show and cancellation rates
  - Outpatient no‑show ranges commonly 5–20% depending on specialty; mental health and dermatology higher; oncology/surgical follow‑ups lower.
  - Sources to cite in deck:
    - Large‑system operational reports (e.g., academic clinics 10–15%).
    - Peer‑reviewed reviews of ambulatory clinic no‑shows (range 5–30%).

- Impact framing for MVP
  - Even +5% reclaimed capacity via auto‑fill → meaningful throughput gain across clinics.
  - Example: Clinic with 1,000 monthly appointments, 10% no‑show/cancel = 100 lost. Filling just half (50) at 30 min each = 25 clinician hours recovered monthly.
